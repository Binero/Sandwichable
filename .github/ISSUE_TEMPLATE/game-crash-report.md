**Description**
Explain what the issue is briefly.

**Steps to Reproduce**
Elaborate on how to reproduce the crash, or explain what happened before the crash to cause it. I would prefer this to be in a step-by-step list.

**Crash Log**
Post a link to the crash log produced by this crash. If you can, try installing Not Enough Crashes or a similar mod to get a "deobfuscated stacktrace" (I will be able to read the crash log better)

**Media**
If you can, post some media (video, gif, link) to further clarify the issue and what causes the crash.
